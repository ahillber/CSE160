      Notes to Grader:
      <br>
      For Asgn3B Requirements: Implemented camera movement with WSAD, and rotation with Q & E. Has 
      <br>
      perspective camera implemented, and a world is implemented to walk around in. You can add and 
      <br>
      delete blocks. Added a simple story to the world where a bunch of knights are lounging in a 
      <br>
      courtyard. Also added a simple game to find the gold block. Also meets performance requirements. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Additional Features: Implemented collision detection. If you try running into the boundary (stone wall),
      <br>
      you will be prevented from crossing it. Also, I added my blocky animal to the world. Furthermore, I 
      <br>
      added buttons on the webpage to choose the material for placing a block. 
      <br>
      <br>
      GAME INSTRUCTIONS: Find randomly generated golden block, walk close to it, and click it to win. 
      <br>
      An alert pops up when found and clicked.
      <br>
      Controls: To DELETE a block, left click and to ADD a block press "x"
